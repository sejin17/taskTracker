# Task Tracker

This is a simple task tracker web application built with Node.js for the backend and vanilla JavaScript for the frontend.

## Project Structure

- **backend/**: Contains the Node.js server and MongoDB models.
- **frontend/**: Contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the client-side application.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the MongoDB server (make sure MongoDB is installed and running):
   ```bash
   mongod
   ```

3. Start the Node.js server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

4. Open `frontend/index.html` in your browser to view the application.

## Deployment

For deployment, you can use services like Heroku or AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Make sure to configure the `Procfile` accordingly.
